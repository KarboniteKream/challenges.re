# Challenge #52

What does this code do?

Additional question: Why did MSVC replace `time()` with `time64()`? Is it correct? Dangerous? What will `printf()` print after the year 2038?

```assembly
$SG3103	DB	'%d', 0aH, 00H

_main	PROC
	push	0
	call	DWORD PTR __imp___time64
	push	edx
	push	eax
	push	OFFSET $SG3103 ; '%d'
	call	DWORD PTR __imp__printf
	add	esp, 16
	xor	eax, eax
	ret	0
_main	ENDP
```

This code prints the current epoch time, and returns `0`.

The function calls `time()` to get the current epoch time. The passed parameter is `0` or `NULL`, which means the return value is not stored. The code is meant for 32-bit processors, since `EAX` is used. Because `time64()` returns a 64-bit value, the value is stored in the `EAX:EDX` pair. The value and the `"%d"` format specified are the passed into `printf()`.

`time()` is a wrapper for `time64()`. This is done so calls to `time()` don't fail after the year 2038 because of integer overflow.
