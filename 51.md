# Challenge #51

If we compile this piece of code in MSVC and run it, three numbers are printed. Where do they come from?

Where do they come from if we compile it in MSVC with optimization (`/0x`)? Why is the situation completely different if we compile with GCC?

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("%d, %d, %d\n");
    return 0;
}
```

Since we don't specify arguments for `printf()`, the function takes the values that are currently on the stack at those addresses.

In the 32-bit version of MSVC, the second or third argument seems to be `argc`, depending on the optimization level. On the 64-bit version, the optimization doesn't seem to have any effect. The third argument seems to always be `1`.

With GCC, all arguments seem to be random. The situtation is different because the code generated by the compiler is different, and the C Runtime Library is different.
